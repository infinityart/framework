# Framework
Personally made framework that I use for projects. It uses code from different tutorials and modifications by my own to fit my needs.

The purpose why I made this project/framework is because I wanted to improve my design patterns and have a solid base to start any project.

# Tutorials
https://code.tutsplus.com/series/the-solid-principles--cms-634 &  https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/agile-design-patterns
I used these tutorials to know more about The solid principles and to improve my design patterns.

This totorial is used to start the framework so I have a solid base and good understanding.
